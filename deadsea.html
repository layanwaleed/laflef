        <h1>DEAD SEA</h1>
        <div id=all>The Dead Sea is located in a desert region, with an average winter temperature of around 17 Â° C.
             The Dead Sea water is characterized by its high salinity and especially on the bottom of the lake, 
             as well as it contains a high percentage of minerals, such as: sulfates,
            bicarbonate, magnesium, hydrogen sulfide, bromine, chlorine, and potassium. 
            The reason for the salinity of the Dead Sea is due to be considered a station for rain water and flowing surface water without the flow of water from it;
            Because it is surrounded by land on three sides, but it is subjected to evaporation; 
            As a result of high temperatures in the summer, or due to hot and dry climatic conditions throughout the year,
            and with the passage of time and the loss of large quantities of water in the sea, this led to an increase in the concentration of salts there.
