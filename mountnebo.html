            Mount Nebo is an elevated ridge of the Abarim in Jordan, approximately 710 metres (2,330 ft) above sea level.
            It is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the place where Moses was granted a view of the Promised Land.
              The view from the summit provides a panorama of the land and, to the north, a more limited one of the valley of the River Jordan.
               The West Bank city of Jericho is usually visible from the summit, as is Jerusalem on a very clear day.
