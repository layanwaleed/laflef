        <h1>UM QAIS</h1>
        <div id=all>
            The windswept village of Umm Qais is well worth the effort of a long journey,
             whether you visit on a day-trip from Irbid or stay overnight to relish the still twilight and fresh, chilly mornings.
              The main attraction is exploring the remote, widespread ruins of the Decapolis city of Gadara, on the edge of modern Umm Qais, 
              some of which are jumbled together with the striking houses of black basalt and white limestone of an abandoned Ottoman village.
               Itâ€™s a popular choice for Friday outings, when the parking area can be filled with family cars and youth-club buses.
