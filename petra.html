           Petra is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. 
           Petra lies around Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin surrounded by mountains which form the eastern flank of the Arabah valley 
           that runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.
           The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7,000 BC,
            and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom,
             as early as the 4th century BC.However, archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,
             by which time Petra had become their capital.
              The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.
