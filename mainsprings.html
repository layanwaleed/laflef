        <div id=all>
            Ma'in Hot Springs or Hammamat Ma'in is the thermal mineral hot springs and waterfalls,
             where Herod the Great was said to have bathed in its medicinal water,
              and where people have come for thermal treatments, or simply to enjoy a hot soak, since the days of Rome.
            Thousands of visiting bathers come each year to enjoy the mineral-rich waters of these hyper-thermal waterfalls.
             These falls originate from winter rainfalls in the highland plains of Jordan and eventually feed the 109 hot and cold springs in the valley.
              This water is heated to temperatures of up to 63Â° Celsius by underground lava fissures as
               it makes its way through the valley before emptying into the Zarqa River.
