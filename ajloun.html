            Ajloun Castle, also called Al Rabad Castle and Salahuddin Castle, 
            is a castle located in Ajloun, Jordan, on top of Jabal Awf (or Jabal Bani Awf),
             which supervises the valleys of Kufranjah, Rajab, and Al-Yabis. It was built by Commander Izz al-Din Osama bin Munqeth,
              one of the leaders of Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi in 1184 A.D. (580 AH), to be a focal point for protecting the region and maintaining
               transportation lines and pilgrim routes between the countries of the Levant and the Hijaz for their supervision of the Jordan Valley and
                their control over the area between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea.
