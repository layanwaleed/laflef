        <h1>AQABA</h1>
        <div id=all>
            When fantasy, sun and sea meet the charms and atmosphere of antiquity,
             the visitor can find himself, at any time of the year, at the 13th century Red Sea resort of Aqaba, which was in ancient times,
              the main port for shipments from the Red Sea to the Far East, known by the names of Aila, Ailana, Elana, Ailath, Elath, Ayla and Wayla.
                For relaxation, water sports, and winter warmth, Aqaba is warm, sunny and inviting, 
                fringed with palm trees, lapped by the crystal clear waters of the Gulf of Aqaba, cooled by a steady northerly breeze,
                 and ringed by mountains that change in color with the change of the hours. Snorkeling, water skiing, wind surfing, para-sailing,
                  fishing and a variety of other water sports, including unsurpassed scuba diving are just some of the popular activities to partake in.
