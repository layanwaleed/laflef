        <div id=all>
            Revered by religious locals and travelers, Jordan's Al Maghtas is thought by many to be the spot where Jesus was baptized.
            The site where Jesus of Nazareth is believed to have been baptized by John the Baptist marks the
             foundation of one of the world’s largest religions and encompasses several other sites significant to all three Abrahamic religions.
             From Amman, it’s only a 45-minute drive on the Dead Sea Highway. Turn right (north) at Sweimeh and follow the signs. From the Dead Sea resorts, 
             the drive is only 15 to 20 minutes,
              in the direction of the Allenby Bridge.
